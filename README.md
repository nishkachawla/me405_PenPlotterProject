# me405_PenPlotterProject

## Project Description
###### For the ME 405 Term Project our team will build a 2.5 axis pen plotter. Our system uses a radial arm rotating arounda hub at which two Ametek-Pittman motors are located. 
###### One motor will contro lthe angular position of the plotter relative to the hub, and the other motor will connect to a lead screw to control the radial position of the pen. 
###### An additional solenoid will be implemented to turn the machine "on" and "off" by raising and lowering the pen. We will use a shaft coupling to connect the lead screw to the motor, on which an ACME nut moves linearly. 
###### The nut will attach to a custom 3D printed fixture which prevents the nut from rolling, and holds the pen. The fixture will slide freely along square tubiing parallel to the screw shaft.
